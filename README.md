Cloud Tracking with Météo-France Radar Data (Alpine Region Focus)

This project aims to detect and track cloud movements using precipitation radar imagery from Météo-France. The primary focus of this analysis is the Alpine Region. By applying advanced image processing algorithms and morphological operations, we identify and track precipitation areas, which serve as indirect indicators of cloud patterns and their dynamics. The project's implementation is carried out using the Julia programming language.

Dataset Overview

The fundamental data source for this project is the "Mosaïque de cumul 5min" dataset from Météo-France. This dataset provides temporally and spatially detailed information on precipitation accumulation, which is crucial for atmospheric observations.

Dataset Specifications

    Product Identification: Mosaïque de cumul 5min

    Description: This is a composite product that represents precipitation accumulation over a 5-minute period. The data is generated by fusing individual radar images from the Météo-France network.

    Geographical Scope: The dataset covers several geographical domains, including Metropolitan France, La Réunion, the Antilles, and New Caledonia. Within this project, we specifically analyze the subset of data corresponding to the Alpine Region within the Metropolitan France domain.

    Format: The data is distributed in the NETCDF format, adhering to the NetCDF Climate and Forecast (CF) Metadata Conventions (CF-1.7).

    Variables: Each NETCDF file contains two primary parameters:

        QUALITY (Quality Code): A dimensionless variable quantifying the data quality of individual mosaic pixels, ranging from 0 (unusable) to 100 (excellent). This variable will be utilized for data selection, prioritizing pixels with higher quality indications.

        ACRR (Water Equivalent): A quantification of the 5-minute precipitation accumulation, expressed in hundredths of millimeters (1/100 mm). This parameter results from the aggregation of individual 5-minute water equivalents from radar detections, corrected for their respective quality codes.

Data Acquisition

The Météo-France radar data is accessible for download via the following URL:

Additional Notes on the Dataset (as per README.pdf):

    The reference date of a NETCDF file corresponds to the start time of its accumulation period.

    For accumulations exceeding 15 minutes, it is recommended to treat missing values (encoded as 65535) as 0 mm.

    The geometry of the mosaic grids is not perfectly rectangular when projected in EPSG:4326.

Project Methodology

The general methodology of this project comprises the following steps, implemented within the Julia environment using specialized packages for image processing and data analysis.

Workflow Outline

    Data Ingestion and Spatial Subset Selection: NETCDF radar images are ingested using packages like NCDatasets.jl and Rasters.jl to extract the ACRR and QUALITY variables. A critical step involves spatially subsetting the data to encompass only the relevant Alpine Region. Furthermore, the QUALITY variable is employed for an initial filtering step, ensuring that only data of sufficient quality is processed.

    Precipitation Detection (Binarization): A threshold is applied to the ACRR (accumulated precipitation) variable to generate binary maps that delineate precipitation areas. Pixels exceeding this threshold are marked as containing precipitation. Pre-processing techniques, such as noise reduction or morphological filtering, can be performed using ImageFiltering.jl and ImageMorphology.jl.

    Clustering of Precipitation Regions: The detected precipitation pixels on the binary map are aggregated into discrete "cloud clusters" or precipitation cells. This can be achieved through morphological operations like connected components labeling from ImageMorphology.jl, or by employing clustering algorithms available in Clustering.jl.

    Object Tracking: Following the identification of precipitation clusters across successive time steps, a tracking methodology will be implemented to monitor their spatiotemporal displacement. The precise algorithms for this phase are currently under development.

    Visualization: The results, including the tracked cloud movements within the Alpine Region, will be visualized. For this purpose, the Julia packages Makie.jl and GeoMakie.jl will be utilized. These packages offer robust tools for scientific data visualization, including geographic projections, enabling clear and interactive presentation of the precipitation data and tracked cloud dynamics.
